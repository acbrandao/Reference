## Video Editing Software
My choice of video editing softwae is DAvVinci resolve, its a pretty beefy program and has some
pretty substantial system requirements, like 16GB of Memory and a GPU enabled PC , but its a professional grade tool and you
can beat the price for the free edition. Also like Adobe PRemier , the little brother to Adobe CC PRemeire suite.

*  [Da Vinci Resolve 16](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/)   combines editing, Fusion visual effects and motion graphics, color correction and Fairlight audio post, all in a single application. 
*  [LightWorks](https://www.lwks.com/) The best free video editing software available, for any level of expertise
*  [Adobe Premiere Elements ](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements.html) a light simpler  version of adobe Premiere for $70
*  [Adobe PRemiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html) Adobes flagship editing software for PC and Mac ($21/month)
